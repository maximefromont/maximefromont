## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maxime Fromont

I am a computer science and software engineering student with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. Currently, I am pursuing an apprenticeship at Alcatel Submarine Network, where I primarily work on professional projects that are not showcased on my GitHub profile.

However, during my free time, I thoroughly enjoy developing tools and software for personal use, as well as for my friends and family whenever there is a need. I always utilize Git as a version control tool, and this GitHub page serves as a platform to showcase some of my personal projects.

### ðŸš€ My Coding Philosophy

My favorite aspect of coding is discovering new and innovative ways to overcome challenges and solve problems. I firmly believe that every problem presents an opportunity for personal growth and learning as a developer. When faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, I am not afraid to discard previous solutions and rebuild from scratch to create an even better outcome. I constantly strive to enhance my current competencies by training daily and exploring new languages and technologies.

### âš¡ Some of My Interests

- Building practical tools and software for personal and family use
- Revisiting and upgrading previous projects with newfound competencies
- Contributing to and/or leading team projects

### ðŸ“« Get in Touch

If you have a personal or professional need, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out to me. You can find my email address on my profile.

Looking forward to collaborating and connecting with like-minded individuals to create meaningful and impactful projects!
